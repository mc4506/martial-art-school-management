  ### Description:
 2020 will go down in history as an unique time in the history of the world due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. It is especially challenging for those who teaches and trains close contact physical sport such as martial arts. With governmental requirements of “social distancing” and limited occupancy for school gatherings, it becomes challenging to maintain the close-knit relationships and communication between Shihan(master instructor) and his or her students. In addition, it becomes a challenge for the Shihan to manage an effective training curriculum of limited in-person classes with virtual video streaming classes that can tailor to the scheduling needs and ranks of all the students in the school.
  


  
  ### User Story:
As a Shihan of a martial arts school:
1. I want to have a web site that allows my students to register an account.
2. I want the student to be able to pick which classes they can take based on their rank/belt.
3. I want the student to be able to choose to take class either in-person or virtually via Zoom. If the student chooses in-person, he or she selects their top 3 preferred time-slots for classes. If there is an open spot in their top preference, they are assigned to that class. Else check if there is an opening in their second preference, and so forth. If there’s no opening in their top 3 preferences, then they are placed in a virtual Zoom class.
4. For each class I need to limit in-person classes to a maximum of 10 people but I can have unlimited students take the class virtually.
5. As the administrator, I want to view all the students, their names, their ranks, and the classes they are in and whether they are taking class in-person or virtually.
6. As the administrator, I want to update a student’s belt color if they rise in rank.
7. I want to have a page that allows me to post information and messages of encouragement to all students and for students to post messages.
